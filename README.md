# Car-Parking-Monitoring
  To provide easy navigation and to make parking vehicles easier. 
  Even a person who is not qualified enough and just knows how to use a computer can use the system.

  This is small program for monitoring parking spaces with the use of sensors, The program represents each parking space with a square box on the screen.
  If a parking space is vacant then the square box turns to green color and if the parking space is in use then the square box turns to red color.

*****The program is not quite portable so it may be buggy on some machines*****

# Set-up Requirements:
  1) Arduino UNO
  2) IR Sensors (The program currently supports only this type of sensor)
  3) USB connector (To connect the UNO Board to a Computer)
  4) Male-Female Connectors (To connect Sensor to the UNO Board)
  5) Set-up Ncurses Library on the computer (The library is used for UI)
